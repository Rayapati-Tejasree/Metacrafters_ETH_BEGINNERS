# TokenCreation

This is a simple Token contract implemented in Solidity. This contract allows for the creation and destruction of tokens, as well as store the information of the token.

## Description
This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for token creation on the Ethereum blockchain.The contract contains "three public variables" that stores the data of the token and two main functions `mint` & `burn` .
1. The `mint` function increases the total supply(no.of Tokens in the account) and the balance of given address by given value.
2. The `burn` function decreases the total supply(no.of Tokens in the account) and the balance of given address by given value
